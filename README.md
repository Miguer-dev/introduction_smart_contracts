# introduction_smart_contracts


This repository encompasses all the knowledge I have accumulated regarding Solidity and smart contracts. You will find the notes I have taken in Class Notes.txt (apologies, it's in Spanish), and within the contracts folder, you will discover a diverse collection of contracts that I have developed as part of my apprenticeship. Additionally, I have included a list of the study materials I have utilized:

- [solidity blockchain developer](https://platzi.com/ruta/desarrollo-solidity/?school=_escuela_blockchain)
- [smart-contract-best-practices](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/)
- [awesome-openzeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/awesome-openzeppelin)
- [openzeppelin docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/)
- [solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
